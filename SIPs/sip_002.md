# SPOOL Improvement Proposal 002


## Abstract
This proposal discusses including the loan period into a loan object, returned
from the ownership loan endpoint.


## Requirement

    - An API user must be able to request a loan object containing the period of
      time a loan was created for, in a machine readable format


## Problem

When creating a loan using `POST /api/ownership/loans/pieces|editions`, an API
user can set `startdate` as well as `enddate` to express the duration of a loan.
While these properties work as expected, when requesting `GET
/api/ownership/loans/pieces|editions(/<id>)*`, they're not included in the
response.

As of now, these properties are only exposed to the user when requesting an
edition|piece, by accessing `loan_history`.
This property is of type string and individual sets of information are
inconvenient to access.


## Solution

When requesting `GET /api/ownership/loans/pieces|editions(/<id>)*`, we
return the following response:

```javascript
{
    "loan": {
        "btc_tx": null,
        "datetime": "2016-03-24T13:47:23.864767Z",
        "id": 2,
        "new_btc_address": null,
        "new_owner": "alice@wonderland.xyz",
        "piece|edition": {...},
        "prev_btc_address": "2016/3/24/13/47/23/309355:mohBA3msbDtsrxACnDwmmjwHyyarABTjCJ",
        "prev_owner": "alice@test.com",
        "status": null,
        "type": "LoanPiece|Loan",
        "startdate": "2016-03-25",
        "enddate": "2016-03-27"
    },
    "notification": "...",
    "success": true
}
```


## Comments


Note that we're returning `startdate` and `enddate` in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`,
as it is the only formating of these properties we allow when creating a
loan.
